# EzPzFontsFlasher-Magisk
Hey Guys,
        I have made a simple script for making flashable magisk modules of your favourite fonts on your device.
        With this scripts you can make it in just one go.
        
Usage:
Type the following command (without '' ) :P
1. Clone this repo to your local machine using the command ' git clone https://github.com/bharathraju2298/EzPzFontsFlasher-Magisk '
2. Now open it using 'cd EzPzFontsFlasher-Magisk'
3. Place the font in this directory.
    ex: EzPzFontsFlasher-Magisk/YourDesiredFont.ttf
4. Run the fonts.sh script using the command
     './fonts.sh YourDesiredFont'
5. When the script has run successfully, you can find the flashable magisk module of your favourite font under 'out' directory with the name "YourDesiredFont.zip"
6. Transfer it to your device and flash it via Magisk / custom recovery like TWRP.




When you want to make the next flashable zip of a font run clean.sh with the command './clean.sh' to clean the out directory.
